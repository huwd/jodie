  work_paragraph1: "You'd like to improve your English? You know the basics, but when it comes to expressing
                    yourself clearly, without apprehension, you're not so sure? Maybe you've got a good level but
                    have reached a plateau in your learning and need an extra push? Or perhaps you're feeling pretty
                    good about your English in general, but you need to use more specialised language for your work
                    or studies ?"

                    a way that totally suits you. The lessons are tailored precisely to your specific needs, interests and

  about_title: 'About me'
  about_subtitle: 'Who is Jodie Jones?'
  about_paragraph1:  "I was born in the UK, on a small farm near the sea in Wales. A love of languages and linguistics
                      lead me to study European languages at Aberystwyth University. During my studies, I became
                      certified by TEFL and spent a year abroad teaching English. As the year progressed, I discovered a
                      love of teaching, and hurried back home to finish my degree before following my chosen career
                      path. Teaching English lead me from Wales to Lyon, Berlin, La Rochelle and to my final
                      destination (for now!) of Poitiers. Along the way I've established a solid foundation in teaching
                      English to people of all levels, using various techniques, and developing the perfect method for
                      individuals, groups, and over Skype."

  about_paragraph2:  "As your teacher, I will accompany you as you go from strength to strength. Any questions, worries
                      or difficulties can be brought to me, and I will help and guide you as you move forward with your
                      learning.

                      See you soon, hopefully!"
